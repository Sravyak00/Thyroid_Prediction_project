Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients by analyzing vital signs and medical history through machine learning techniques. It is designed to compare multiple algorithms, emphasizing both predictive accuracy and interpretability, to identify the most dependable model for clinical use.

Key Features

Dataset: 100,000 patient records with 8 critical features, including BMI, glucose levels, hypertension, age, and smoking history.

Algorithms:

Random Forest – Best performer with 97.03% accuracy and 96.97% precision.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – Strong predictive power (95.24%) with high interpretability.

Naïve Bayes – Efficient and robust, particularly with categorical inputs.

Preprocessing: Applied label encoding, Min-Max scaling, and correlation analysis for clean, normalized training data.

Validation: Used 10-fold cross-validation to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for comprehensive performance assessment.

Goal

The project highlights how data-driven approaches can support early diabetes detection by analyzing essential clinical attributes, enabling proactive healthcare strategies and improved patient monitoring.
